This is a step by step protocol to conduct an experiment in the *Tribolium* system to get at individual variation in egg laying. The goal is to get at the distribution of egg laying at the individual level.

# Prep Info


## Materials
- Large and small metal beetle bowls
- Paintbrush
- Petri dish
- Sieve
- 400 square plastic containers
- 4 Stock Containers
- 2 kg of media
- Metal scoop 
- Labeling tape
- 50 microcentrifuge tubes


## Experimental Container Prep
1. Place a piece of labeling tape on each container, using a different color for each group (A-D)
2. For each label include the following:
    + Unique ID - Letter/Number Combo
    + Date
    + Initials
3. Place 5 grams of media into each container (or just a single scoop)

# Seeding Info
1. For each stock container, place 100 beetles into each (A-D)
    - 400 beetles total
2. Allow beetles 6 hours to mate
3. Transfer each individual into its own container
    - Make sure those from container A go into the A boxes and so on
4. Allow beetles 24 hours to lay eggs
5. Remove beetles after they lay eggs
    - Store 50 beetles, from a single group, in individual microcentrifuge tubes with unique ID (this is in case we need to sex them)


# Census
1. Take each box and sieve out beetles
2. Count the beetles in the box and place them into a tared petri dish
3. Weigh the beetles
4. Record the number of beetles and the weight for each box
